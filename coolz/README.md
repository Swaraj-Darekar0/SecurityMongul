# MedSecure Hospital Management System (Mocked Demo)

This is a mocked repository for demo purposes. It contains intentionally insecure and illustrative code patterns to exercise static analysis, SCA, and report generation workflows for HIPAA-related findings.

See the `policies/` folder for compliance context and `app/` for sample Python code that triggers analyzer heuristics.
